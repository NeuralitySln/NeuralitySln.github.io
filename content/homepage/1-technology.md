## Revolutionary Biosignal Interface Technology

Neurality Solutions pioneers the next generation of human-machine interfaces through three breakthrough innovations that redefine how we interact with digital systems.

### üî¨ Distributed Forearm Recording

**Beyond Traditional Wearables**

Our proprietary geodesic electrode arrays deployed across the forearm capture significantly more neural information than conventional bracelet-based systems. By distributing sensors across a larger anatomical area, we achieve:

- **Enhanced Signal Fidelity**: 3x more data points than traditional wrist-based devices
- **Robust Movement Tracking**: Multi-point sensing that adapts to natural limb motion
- **Superior Spatial Resolution**: Precise localization of muscle activation patterns

### ‚ö° Intent Detection Technology

**Anticipating Action Before Movement**

Our advanced EMG signal processing detects neural intent milliseconds before physical movement begins, enabling unprecedented responsiveness in human-machine interfaces:

- **30% Faster Response Times**: Intent detection precedes mechanical button presses
- **Gaming Interface Revolution**: Sub-threshold activation for competitive advantage
- **Predictive Control Systems**: Neural patterns inform action before muscle contraction
- **Seamless Spatial Computing**: Natural gesture prediction for AR/VR environments

### üõ°Ô∏è Biosignal Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)

**World's First ANC for Human-Machine Interfaces**

Our dual-layer electrode system provides robust signal quality in real-world environments through active noise cancellation specifically designed for biosignals:

- **Environmental Noise Suppression**: Maintains signal integrity in noisy conditions
- **Real-time Adaptive Filtering**: Dynamic adjustment to changing environments
- **Motion Artifact Reduction**: Stable performance during active use
- **Clinical-Grade Reliability**: Consistent performance across diverse settings
